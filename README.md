# Rosie Portfolio

The Rosie Porfolio Project was created as part of a series of lessons from the Code Institute. The lessons initially covered HTML and CSS, before returning and adding JavaScript with the Google Maps API. This has now been updated to use Leaflet.js for the mapping.

### Features

The website is comprised of 6 pages: The home page, resume page, contact page, interests page, github page and 404 page. 

* All Pages on the website have:

  - Top navigation bar. This enables users to easily navigate through the website regardless of the page they are on. The top navigation bar also allows users to download a copy of Rosie's CV.

* Future Implementations.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
