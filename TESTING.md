### JavaScript Validation

JS Hint was used to validate the JavaScript on the site.

* [github-information.js](documentation/testing/js-github-info-validation.png) - Passed 
* [maps.js](documentation/testing/js-map-validation.png) - warnings for undefined variable `L` and unused variable `marker`. I have left these as is for now as I have taken the code from the example directly from the Leaflet website.
